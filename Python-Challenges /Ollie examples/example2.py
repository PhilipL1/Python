 # <QUESTION 2>

    # Given an integer - representing total seconds - return a tuple of integers (of length 4) representing 
    # days, hours, minutes, and seconds

    # <EXAMPLES>

    # two(270) → (0, 0, 4, 30)
    # two(3600) → (0, 1, 0, 0)
    # two(86400) → (1, 0, 0, 0)

    # <HINT>

    # There are 86,400 seconds in a day, and 3600 seconds in an hour

def two(total_seconds):
    total_seconds
